## Terms

I'm lazy so heres a quick terms guide.

### General Terms

* Witch Queen -> WQ
* Seasonal Artifact -> SA
* Elemental Well -> EW

### Affinity 

* Void -> V
* Solar -> S
* Arc -> A
* Stasis -> ST

### Other Notes

* Armor mods will be denoted with an affinity and the cost of each mod.
  * Example: Void mod with a cost of 2 -> `(V, 2)`

## Elemental Well Mods

These are probably (you're taking advice from some random dude on the internet so keep that in mind when this doesn't work out) the best mods for day 1 WQ. Most of this will revolve around making elemental wells due to the orb generation changes and charged with light nerfs. Since we are all going to be 20 light under (competion mode for day 1 yay!) we will most certainly need some level of protection. Most of us will be running void subclasses most of the time and anyone that is not should be able to 

### Generating Wells

#### Reaping Wellmaker 

* Cost: `(V, 2)`
* Cast your class ability and then get a kill with any gun and you will spawn a void well.
* This generates a VOID WELL regardless of your subclass, guns etc.

#### Elemental Ordnance 

* Cost: `(Any, 3)`
* Defeating a combatant with your grenade spawns a well that matches your subclass.
* Probably the most consistent way of creating EWs.

#### Melee Wellmaker

* Cost: `(Any, 1 from SA)` 
* Powered melee kills generate an elemental well matching your subclass.

### Using Wells

#### Well of Tenacity 

* Cost: `(V, 2)`
* Activated by picking a VOID EW regardless of what subclass you are on.
* Replaces Protective Light.
* 50% damage reduction for 5 seconds after picking up an elemental well.
* This can be increased by using [`Elemntal Time Dilation`](#elemental-time-dilation)

#### Font of Might 

* Cost: `(Any, 1 from SA)`
* Increases damage of a gun matching the picked up EW affinity, and your subclass affinity by 25%.
* 10 seconds base.
* This can be increased by using [`Elemntal Time Dilation`](#elemental-time-dilation).
* This can be stacked with [`Volatile Flow`](#volatile-flow).
  * Pairing this with [`Elemntal Time Dilation`](#elemental-time-dilation) will allow it to roughly match the duration of [`Volatile Flow`](#volatile-flow)
 
#### Volatile Flow

* Cost: `(Any, 2)`
* After picking up a VOID EW your VOID weapons are given volatile rounds.
* Volatile rounds apply volatile to combatants which you can then explode for more damage.
* This can be stacked with [`Font of Might`](#font-of-might).

### Other Elemental Well Mods

#### Seeking Wells 

* Cost: `(A, 2)`
* Pulls any EW to you.
* Convienent, not super necessary.
 
#### Bountiful Wells

* Cost: `(S, 2)`
* Creates an extra EW of the same affinity for every copy of this mod equipped.
* Useful for when EW effects stack, has no effect on [`Well of Tenacity`](#well-of-tenacity) which is our main focus here. 

#### Elemental Time Dilation 

* Cost: `(ST, 3)`
* Increases the duration of time limited well effects.
* These can be stacked.
* Probably should have at least one of these. [`Well of Tenacity`](#well-of-tenacity) only lasts 5 seconds by default.

#### Well of Life

* Cost: `(S, 2)`
* Provides constant health regen for 10 seconds after picking up a SOLAR EW.

### Example Mod Configuration

These are some example builds and ways these EW mods can be configured.

#### Build 1

This confiuration will take maximum advantage of VOID EWs by giving surviveablitly through [`Well of Tenacity`](#well-of-tenacity) and extra damage through [`Volatile Flow`](#volatile-flow). Currently this configuration is based around maximum well generation but we could add in more weapon damage by replacing one of the EW generation mods with [`Font of Might`](#font-of-might).

* Sublcass: VOID
* Guns
  * Energy: VOID
  * Heavy: VOID preferred
* Mods
  * [`Well of Tenacity`](#well-of-tenacity)
  * [`Reaping Wellmaker`](#reaping-wellmaker) or [`Font of Might`](#font-of-might)
  * [`Volatile Flow`](#volatile-flow)
  * [`Elemental Ordnance`](#elemental-ordnance) or [`Font of Might`](#font-of-might)
  * [`Elemental Time Dilation`](#elemental-time-dilation)

#### Build 2

This configuration will still be able to make use VOID EWs using [`Reaping Wellmaker`](#reaping-wellmaker) but also be able to take advantage of solar wells for more damage. [`Font of Might`](#font-of-might) could also be replaced by [`Well of Life`](#well-of-life) for increased survivability.  

* Subclass: SOLAR
* Guns
  * Energy: SOLAR
  * Heavy: SOLAR preferred
* Mods
  * [`Well of Tenacity`](#well-of-tenacity)
  * [`Reaping Wellmaker`](#reaping-wellmaker)
  * [`Elemental Ordnance`](#elemental-ordnance)
  * [`Elemental Time Dilation`](#elemental-time-dilation)
  * [`Font of Might`](#font-of-might) or [`Well of Life`](#well-of-life)

## Guns

All the guns that are probably worth having ready for day 1.

### Kinetic

#### Exotics

* Witherhoard
* Arbalest
* Outbreak Perfected
* Izanagi's
* Ager's Scepter
* Osteo Striga

#### Legendary

* Sniper Rifle
* Scout Rifle/Pulse Rifle
* Blinding Grenades GL
* Slug Shotgun
* Preferred Ad Clear Weapons

### Energy 

If you are running a VOID subclass, preference should be given to VOID weapons so that you can take advantage of [`Volatile Flow`](#volatile-flow).

#### Exotics

* Dead Messenger
* Erianna's
* Divinity
* Le Monarque
* Ticuu's
* Vex
* Ruinous Effigy
* Telesto

#### Legendary

* Preferred ad clear weapon of each affinity
  * Have ~~Ikelos SMG~~ (DISABLED) ready just in case. It is currently bugged and doing 40% extra damage to red-bars

* Scout Rifle/Pulse Rifle
* Slug Shotgun
* Blinding Grenades GL
* Waveframe GL
* Fusion Rifles
* Glaive

### Heavy

#### Exotics

  * 50% damage reduction against bosses has apparently been removed, possible bug, may be resolved by raid day.

  * Not actually good (I think) but picking up a heavy brick then switching to this gun gives max or close to max heavy ammo.

#### Legendary

* Linear Fusion Rifle
  * Threaded Needle is ideal to take advantage of [`Volatile Flow`](#volatile-flow)
* Spike GL
* Clown Cartridge Rocket
* Auto Loading Rocket
* Machine Gun
* Sword
